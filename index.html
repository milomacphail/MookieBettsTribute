          <p id="tribute-info">Angels centerfielder Mike Trout has had a stranglehold on the American League MVP for the last five years (well, not actually, but he <em>SHOULD</em> have). That might be about to change this year. Not because Trout is bad (in fact, he might be better than ever. Not just his best ever, the best player ever, period.), but because Red Sox rightfielder Mookie Betts is having an electrifying year on a Red Sox team that is poised to challenge the 2001 Mariners for the best regularseason record of all time. <br><br>Betts, whose first full season was 2015, had a breakout 2016, slashing .318/.364/.534. That was followed by a (debatably) disappointing 2017, where though mananging an OBP of .344, his hitting was down. That 2017 may go down as just being the calm before a hurricane of a 2018 wherein Mookie has been nothing less than spectacular. He is slashing .347/.434/.668 while hitting for even more power than 2016. His wRC+ (which measures how he compares, roughly to the average MLB player) is an ungodly 191, one point better than, you got it, Mike Trout. <br><br> Moreover, Betts is the most riveting player to watch on baseball's best team. He hits for the cycle, plays incredible defense, ends a 13 pitch at-bat with a grand slam so tense and ultimately cathartic that a  baseball neophyte might wonder if championships are won during games against the Blue Jays in July. He is a world class bowler. Whether Betts is able to ride these stats and that magnetism to an MVP award (or more importantly, a World Series trophy) remains to be seen. However, if he does end up keeping Trout from a third award in five years, it will be because he damn well deserves it.<br><br>For more information about Mookie, check out his stats on <a id=tribute-link href="https://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=13611&position=OF" target="_blank">FanGraphs</a>.
